**Readme for Area of Triangle Program**

**Description:**
The "AreaOfTriangle" program, created by Okunlola Faozee Bayo, is written in Fortran. This program calculates the area of a triangle using the lengths of its sides. The side lengths are read from an external file named "Input.txt," and the results are written to "Output.txt."

**Usage:**
1. Run the program by executing the provided Fortran code.
2. Ensure that the input file "Input.txt" contains the values of sides a, b, and c, separated by spaces.
3. The program will compute the area of the triangle and the angle theta using the input side lengths.
4. The results will be written to the "Output.txt" file.

**Output Format:**
- The program outputs a table in "Output.txt" containing the calculated angle theta and the corresponding area of the triangle.

**Note:**
- The program uses the law of cosines to calculate the angle theta and then computes the area using the formula: `Area = 0.5 * a * b * sin(theta)`.

**About:**
The Area of Triangle Program demonstrates the use of a subroutine (`Calculator`) for mathematical computations. It provides a practical example of trigonometric calculations in Fortran, showcasing how to determine the area of a triangle given its side lengths.
